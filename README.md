# stock_options

## Prerequisites

`pip install yfinance`
`pip install pandas`

## How to run this

Example code is in `option_chain.py`. Nothing fancy at the moment.

## To Dos

1. Multiple output file formats (.csv, .txt etc.)
2. Integration with Google Sheets APIs
3. Include Naked Calls and Naked Puts (Personally, I don't like using margins)
